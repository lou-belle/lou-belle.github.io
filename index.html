Hi, welcome to my website. I'm Lou Belle, a high functioning South African lunatic, whom will unapologetically testify that I live in the most beautiful country in the world. Together with my husband - whom is annoyingly perfect - and our three feral farm kids, I live on a lovely farm that boasts some spectacular views. I'm not a farmer - life seems to take a sadistic type of pleasure in daily reminding me of this fact. Inspite of these challenges, I love it!<br /><br />

Heads up, I'm not a writer either, at least not technically. Infact I failed first grade, and was completely illiterate until my fifth grade remedial teacher completely infected me with a love of literature. By the end of that year I was reading my father's Wilber Smith novels and getting a whole different type of education. I will be eternally indebted to that teacher for all the worlds of wonder she opened the door upon. Today I am a qualified special needs educator, who for the moment has pressed pause on my career to educate my own children.<br /><br />

There are days, when home schooling and the isolation of the farm feel oppressively prohibative, and I desperately miss adult company and interaction - also having my own money. And so, dear reader, I made some up. Yes indeed, I have embarked upon the bold adventure of writing, I hope you'll join me.<br /><br />
